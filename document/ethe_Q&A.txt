Is the Main Network the DAO?
Dante · Lecture 5 · a month ago

What is the difference between a Network, DAO and a blockchain?

GK
Greg  · a month ago 

Yes, the main Ethereum network is a DAO.

A network can be from one node, desktop computers, servers, mobile, tablet devices, person to another.  
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization is essentially code that outlines governance and rules for a given organization that runs on a blockchain.   
A DAO runs a smart contract or smart contracts.  
A blockchain ( a very simple way of thinking about it) is essentially a series of crypto secure distributed excel spreadsheets, data structures, that are replicated (striped) across an array of nodes (desktop computers, servers, mobile and tablet devices).


@ Valerie. Thanks that clear things up. However what exactly is a Decentralized Network then? Is it simply referring to the Ethereum Network as a whole?

Jaro  · a month ago 
I would say it a bit diferently;

The network consists of nodes, this is the infrastructure. This network uses blockchain as its protocol, an agreement how 'true state' is defined and agreed upon by the nodes on the network. Based on this you can create a DAO where the 'data/state' is decentrally managed by rules of a contract, this could be seen as the application.

Ethereum is one of many Decentralized networks.  Decentralized generally refers to no central control.  No central server.  Facebook, Google etc own and control their servers, they are centralized.  In a blockchain the miners who number in the thousands, generally, solve the crypto puzzles to mine the blocks, the data sets.

How is the proof of work related to the public key?
Rwiju · Lecture 13 · a month ago
Wanted a clarification

Does the public key has the proof of work which a miner needs to solve to make a block valid

Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
The miner who finds the successful proof of work solution has their address added onto the block 'header'.  It indicates the person/entity who found the solution.

Thanks Stephen. But i am still a bit confused. So a person sends a block using his private key to the network. the miners users the public key to access it and solve the proof of work and then add it to the chain. is that the sequence of operations or am i missing something over here

Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
You're very close, just a few small changes to your description-

A user will send a transaction to the network.  A miner will receive that transaction, validate it, then add it to a block and solve the proof of work algorithm.  A miner may receive many transactions in one instant, so they get the benefit of deciding which transactions will be added to a block.  To decide that, they'll look at the gasPrice that each user is willing to pay, then select the transactions with the highest gasPrice.  That maximizes the amount of money they (the miner) get paid.

Thanks a lot. sorry to bug with you with basics but just want to get a better clarity. I have couple of questions

a) In bitcoin, if we are following only the transaction and not the net balance. Then suppose bob send tim, n coin then do the miners check all the transaction that bob has done from the beginning of time. Seems to be a cumbersome method.

b) What are the types of validation the miners can do, I am guessing I cant randomly ask then to validate a data from the net because then the network will never be able to come to a  consensus and the whole system would break

   

Mark as helpful
Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
A) You are correct, every node will replay all transactions.  Yes, this is cumbersome but it is apart of the security and consistency that a blockchain provides.

B) Not sure what you mean by this question, can you tell me exactly what you mean by 'types of validation'?

So if in a contract i want to compare the dollar exchange rate/stock price of a company. Now at different point of time the rate will be different and the miner will find it difficult to come to a consensus. So I am guessing I cant run a program like this on ethereum. if we can can you please explain how it works (if consensus building is difficult among miners)

Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
Ah, I see what you're getting at.  Yes, your intuition is correct.  Here's the rule of thumb: information can flow into a contract as arguments, but the contract cannot reach out of the network for anything.

The exact value of arguments that we call a function with can be (and are) recorded on the blockchain, so in 5 years we'll know exactly how you called a function today.  However, if a contract reached out to some 3rd party API, it might return a completely different value in 5 years than what it returns today, so we would not be able to 'replay' transactions to verify the current state.

Mark as helpful
Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
Followup: That means no network requests to outside api.  It also means no true random number generation (RNG), because true RNG would mean that replaying transactions in the future could lead to different outcomes.

Thanks a lot stephen. 

However, i was going through the net and i stumbled across something called oracle. Is it something that i should read upon if I want to build a contract which want to communicate to the outside world. just wanted your opinion

Mark as helpful
Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
Yes, 'oracle' is a term for a service that can be used to pull in outside info.  There are also oracles that provide better RNG solutions.

14. Block Times

Nonce increment in order?
Johan · Lecture 14 · a month ago
Is the nonce really incremented 0, 1, 2, 3...? Wouldn't this result in the fastest GPU *always* solving it first? Then there would be no reason for the people with worse GPU to mine?

VD
Vaibhav  · a month ago 
Nonce of a block is different than the nonce of a transaction. 

Block nonce is used in mining process.

Transaction nonce is used to keep a track of how many transactions have been initiated by a particular address. So lets say the address was 0x123. When this address initiates a 1st transaction, nonce will be 0. Few days later, this address initiates another transaction, nonce will be 1 and so on. You get the idea.

===============================
14. Block Times

Who did I send my transaction to?
Nathan · Lecture 14 · a month ago
You mentioned that the client sends the transaction to just one node.

The chances of that node to win the proof of work are very low, yet my transaction is still there. How did the winning node get my transaction in there?

Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
The node that you broadcast your transaction to will re-broadcast the transaction to the rest of the network as well.  All nodes have the opportunity to see the entire pool of pending transactions and then pick and choose which ones they want to include in a block.

15. Smart Contracts

What is the limit on the storage in a smart contract?
Adam · Lecture 15 · a month ago
I am curious on how much data storage you can put into a smart contract and at what cost? Lets say you wanted to save 5KB of data, how much would that cost?

Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
There's a great article on this here: https://hackernoon.com/ether-purchase-power-df40a38c5a2f

25. Gas and Transaction

One.
Gas Price v.s. Gas Limit
Matthew · Lecture 25 · 3 days ago
After rewatching the video lecture, I still cannot have a clear understanding about the difference between Gas Price and Gas Limit....Is there a better way or a better explanation about these two nouns?

AN
Anaam  · 2 days ago 
Gas Limit is the number of units like 1 Gas 2 Gas while gas price is like price of that unit 1 gas = 4 wei and 2 gas = 8 wei
I think it is like this

Mark as helpful (1)
Stephen — Instructor  · 2 days ago 
Anaam is correct.  Another way to think of this is like buying gasoline (petrol) for your car.  When you go to a gas station in your car, you pay a certain amount of money per liter.  That is equivalent to Ethereum's gasPrice.  Likewise, your car can only hold a certain amount of liters of gasoline - thats the absolute max amount of liters that you're willing to purchase.  Same thing for Ethereum's gasLimit.

Does Gas implemented every Cryptocurrency
Cemal · Lecture 25 · 22 days ago
Hi,

Does gas method implemented for every cryptocurrency? Is there any way to make gasPrice=0 for private applications ?

Thanks in advance / Cemal

Raymond  · 22 days ago 
Gas has to be implemented in any cryptocurrency if there is any miner in it doing validation work for the network and getting paid with those gas. So if you get gasPrice to 0, then no miner will validate your transaction, then your transaction will never be included in the blockchain.

Who receives this Gas ether that we spend on every transaction
Dhaval · Lecture 25 · 2 months ago
Who receives this ether that we are spending on every transaction ?

K
Kevin  · 2 months ago  Answer 
The nodes that mine the blockchain. It is payment for processing the transaction. It will also help prioritize processing though I am not sure if this is in place yet. Miners would process transactions paying a higher rate for gas before transactions paying a lower rate. So, you could pay to get your transactions mined faster.

Stephen — Instructor  · 2 months ago 
Kevin is correct, it goes to the miner who successfully solves the proof of work algorithm for the block.

Anna  · a month ago 
Is Kevin right in that there will be a hierarchy of whose transactions gets processed first based on the rate that they are paying?

Mark as helpful
Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
Anna - That is correct.  Its a sort of auction system.  If you submit a transaction with a very low gas value then its possible that no miner will pick up your transaction for a long time.

This is identical to the Bitcoin mining system - in the news right now you'll see mentions of how long it takes for transactions to be approved (possibly days!).  In reality, you can get a Bitcoin transaction approved within 20 minutes if you are wiling to pay enough for it.

30. Boiler plate requirement

ABI / API
Maciej · Lecture 30 · a month ago
Hi, what does ABI and API mean? In this video you've said that ABI and bytecode are getting out of the compiler. So is ABI some kind of instruction for computer about how to read this bytecode? And when it comes to API, I thought that it's instruction for two separate programs to understand eachother, but then I heard someone who said that "API i.e. facebook, twitter etc.".

Raymond  · a month ago 
Yes, ABI is the instruction on how to read the bytecode. Yes, API is the instruction for two separate programs to talk to each other.

45. Deployed Inbox Overview

What is the rationale behind setting gas price to 1000000
Sai · Lecture 45 · a month ago
When i modified the above price, I'm getting an error 

"base fee exceeds gas limit " 

Raymond  · a month ago 
The total cost of a transaction (the "TX fee") = the Gas Limit * Gas Price
The gas price is like gasoline price for adding gas to your car.

Sai  · a month ago 
Raymond, Thanks for the reply

Question is : why did he set to 1,000,000? Why not something else?

Mark as helpful
Raymond  · a month ago 
If the price is too low, then the transaction will not be chosen by the miners to be included into the next block. But if the transaction is too high, then the user is paying a too high price... So there is a balance between the two bad cases. I don't know exactly what is the price. But the price of anything is determined by the market economics, the supply and demand. You just try a few times and then you will know what is a good price to pay.

Mnemonic privacy issue.
Jacob · Lecture 52 · a month ago
This seems like a bit of a security issue for me, when you have to store your mnemonic in the clear in your code. This means that it is highly recommended that you don't share a MetaMask user for your investments and your developments, as a potential intruder could get access to both if he gets your mnemonic ?

Stephen — Instructor  · a month ago 
Correct, keep that mnemonic safe.

Alexander  · 19 days ago 
make a file for keys and add it to .gitignore so you don't accidentally commit it to github :) and just import mnemonic from that file... and yes, never again use this account anyway...

61. The Message Global Variable

Msg global variable
Vinicius · Lecture 61 · a month ago
The msg global variable is visible outside of the functions? Well, I don't think so, probably that variable are created when a function is called, and what happen with it after the call or transaction ends? I hope that I was clear! 
Thanks Stephen, I'm really enjoying the course!

David  · a month ago  Answer 
The msg is a global variable so it's not created every time you create a new function, there is already one instance of that variable created even if you don't use it in your contract.

You can use the global variables in different functions as many times as you want, and it will always return the same value.

Where does money from the players go to?

Ashwin · Lecture 70 · 2 months ago
It feels like it goes to the wallet of the manager. But it looks like it exists in the Contract.

Stephen — Instructor  · 2 months ago 
The money belongs to the contract.  Contract accounts are just like 'external accounts' owned by people like you and me.  They can hold ether just like us.
