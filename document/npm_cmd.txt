Build tools
If you are on windows, open up your terminal as administrator and run the following command:

npm install --global --production windows-build-tools 

Thats it!  This installs a few build tools that are required to install web3 successfully on a Windows machine. You should only have to run this one time. Let the command do its thing then continue on.
